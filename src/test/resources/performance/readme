the script testPerformance.sh will run performance load testing in three phases:

1. Use the json file in generatePerfData/payloadFolder/payload.txt 
   to create a tar archive with corresponding XML and JSON requests. 
   Note that each XML/JSON pair has a Unique GUID 

2. Use the templates in perf/templates to perform JSON->XML and XML->JSON transforms
   This takes place as two merge calls, and response time includes file-i/o to both 
   read the request and write the response. 

3. Now all of the transformed files are diff'd against their generated counterpart to validate
   that the transformations were successful. This is the longest step of the process.
